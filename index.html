            <h2>About Fiwo</h2>
            <h1>A Deterministic Language for Precise Thought, Human Communication, and Artificial Intelligence</h1>
            <p>Fiwo is a constructed language engineered as a precision communication system rather than a natural or artistic language. Its purpose is to eliminate structural ambiguity, reduce interpretive guesswork, and make meaning explicit, inspectable, and deterministic. When used according to its rules, especially in Strict Mode, every valid Fiwo sentence yields exactly one syntactic interpretation.</p>
            <p>Fiwo treats language as an interface:</p>
            <p>an interface between human minds, between humans and machines, and between abstract thought and formal expression.</p>
            <p>Rather than relying on inference, shared cultural assumptions, or pragmatic ambiguity, Fiwo encodes grammatical roles, hierarchy, and scope directly into its surface structure. Meaning is not guessed—it is declared.</p>
            <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
            <h3>Precision Without Excess: A Deliberate Balance Between Human and Machine</h3>
            <p>Fiwo is designed around a single guiding objective:</p>
            <p>to achieve deterministic precision without sacrificing learnability or practical use.</p>
            <p>Absolute precision in language is easy to pursue—and equally easy to overdo. Systems that attempt to encode every nuance explicitly often become dense, fragile, and inaccessible to real users. At the other extreme, natural languages prioritize flexibility and expressiveness but rely heavily on ambiguity, inference, and shared context, which limits their reliability in technical, global, or machine-mediated communication.</p>
            <p>Fiwo exists to walk the narrow path between these extremes.</p>
            <h4>1. Determinism Over Interpretation</h4>
            <p>Fiwo replaces interpretive guesswork with explicit structure. Meaning is not inferred from context, speaker intent, or cultural convention; it is encoded directly in the sentence form.</p>
            <p>In Fiwo, grammatical roles, hierarchy, and scope are structurally visible. When used in Strict Mode, every valid sentence produces exactly one syntactic parse tree. If multiple interpretations are possible, the sentence is considered structurally incomplete and must be rewritten.</p>
            <p>This ensures that meaning is declared, not negotiated.</p>
            <h4>2. Separation of Meaning and Structure</h4>
            <p>Fiwo enforces a strict division between:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lexical meaning (what a word refers to), and</li>
                <li>Structural function (how words relate to each other).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Lexical certainty is encoded through functional vowels that define word category. Structural certainty is encoded through a small, closed set of grammatical markers that control hierarchy and scope.</p>
            <p>This separation prevents semantic drift, stabilizes the grammar over time, and allows meaning to scale in complexity without increasing ambiguity.</p>
            <h4>3. Precision Through Structure, Not Proliferation</h4>
            <p>Rather than increasing precision by adding layers of inflection, cases, or specialized particles, Fiwo achieves clarity through minimal but mandatory structure.</p>
            <p>A small number of structural markers—used consistently—provide the same disambiguating power as far more complex grammatical systems. This avoids the common failure mode of precision languages: becoming theoretically exact but practically unusable.</p>
            <p>In Fiwo, complexity is allowed only when it produces measurable clarity.</p>
            <h4>4. Minimalism With Depth</h4>
            <p>Fiwo’s minimalism is not expressive limitation. Depth is achieved through controlled derivation and compositional rules, not through an ever-expanding lexicon or irregular forms.</p>
            <p>A compact core vocabulary supports:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>technical expansion</li>
                <li>domain-specific terminology</li>
                <li>and precise conceptual layering</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>5. Learnability as a Design Constraint</h4>
            <p>Learnability is treated as a hard requirement, not a secondary benefit.</p>
            <p>Fiwo removes many of the obstacles that make natural languages difficult:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>irregular morphology,</li>
                <li>hidden grammatical agreement,</li>
                <li>exception-based rules,</li>
                <li>context-dependent word classes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once the core rules are learned, they apply universally. Progress comes from understanding structure rather than memorizing exceptions.</p>
            <h4>6. Bridging Human and Machine Constraints</h4>
            <p>Humans favor rhythm, pattern reuse, and predictable structure.</p>
            <p>Machines require explicit markers, deterministic rules, and unambiguous scope.</p>
            <p>Fiwo is engineered at the intersection of these needs. Its phonology, morphology, and syntax are designed to remain intuitive for human speakers while being fully machine-parseable without heuristic interpretation.</p>
            <p>Rather than optimizing for one at the expense of the other, Fiwo treats both humans and machines as first-class users of the language.</p>
            <h4>The Result</h4>
            <p>Fiwo is neither a natural language nor a programming language.</p>
            <p>It is a precision protocol for meaning—a system that enforces clarity while remaining usable, learnable, and scalable.</p>
            <p>By consciously limiting complexity and insisting on structural transparency, Fiwo demonstrates that precision and practicality are not opposing goals, but outcomes of intentional design.</p>
            <h2>Phonological Design and Global Accessibility</h2>
            <p>Fiwo’s phonetic inventory was selected based on global prevalence, perceptual distinctness, and combinatory power.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Phonemes were chosen from sounds that appear widely across the world’s major language families.</li>
                <li>The system avoids rare, unstable, or highly language-specific contrasts.</li>
                <li>Sounds were selected not only individually, but also for their ability to combine into phoneme sequences that naturally occur in many unrelated languages.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The result is a phonology that feels familiar across linguistic backgrounds while remaining internally consistent.</p>
            <p>Fiwo uses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a defined syllable structure (C)(C)(C)V,</li>
                <li>no tone system,</li>
                <li>no mandatory stress rules,</li>
                <li>direct sound-to-symbol mapping in orthography.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What you see is what you say.</p>
            <p>This makes Fiwo:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>easy to pronounce,</li>
                <li>resilient to accent variation,</li>
                <li>and robust in noisy or imperfect transmission.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Why Fiwo Is Easier to Learn Than Natural Languages</h2>
            <p>Fiwo removes many of the obstacles that make natural languages difficult:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No irregular verbs</li>
                <li>No grammatical exceptions</li>
                <li>No silent letters</li>
                <li>No hidden agreement rules</li>
                <li>No context-dependent word classes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Instead, learners benefit from:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>predictable morphology,</li>
                <li>visible grammatical roles,</li>
                <li>a small, structured core vocabulary,</li>
                <li>and logical derivation rather than memorization.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once the rules are learned, they apply universally. Mastery comes from understanding structure, not accumulating exceptions.</p>
            <h2>Who Fiwo Is For</h2>
            <p>Fiwo is designed for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learners who want a language that rewards clarity and logical thinking</li>
                <li>AI researchers and developers who need deterministic, machine-safe language input</li>
                <li>Engineers and system designers working with formal specifications or protocols</li>
                <li>Writers and worldbuilders seeking a language that can support precise, internally consistent systems</li>
                <li>Philosophers and theorists interested in language as a tool for thought</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Example: Why Structure Matters</h2>
            <p>Natural language:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“I saw the man with the telescope.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Multiple interpretations are possible.</p>
            <p>Fiwo (Strict Mode):</p>
            <p>Structure and scope are explicitly encoded, allowing only one valid reading. Any alternative interpretation must be structurally rewritten, making ambiguity impossible by design.</p>
            <h2>In Summary</h2>
            <p>Fiwo is a language for those who want control over meaning, not negotiation with it.</p>
            <p>By enforcing clarity at every level—from sound, to word, to sentence structure—it transforms language into a reliable tool for exact thought, human communication, and machine interaction.</p>

            <h3>III. Syntax &amp; Structure (The Logic Layer)</h3>
            <h4>Rule 5: Basic Word Order</h4>
            <p>Fiwo uses a <strong>fixed default order</strong>:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Subject – Verb – Object (SVO)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Example: <code>mi lo batui te mito.</code> (I eat meat)</p>
            <p>An alternative <strong>passive-like structure</strong> is allowed:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Object – Verb – Subject (OVS)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This requires the particle <strong><code>bii</code></strong>.</p>
            <p>Example: <code>te mito lo batui <strong>bii</strong> mi</code> ( the meat was eaten by me)</p>
            <h4>Rule 6: Marker System (Predicate &amp; Object Locking)</h4>
            <p>Fiwo separates <strong>lexical certainty</strong> from <strong>structural certainty</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Word endings encode <strong>category</strong></li>
                <li>Markers encode <strong>hierarchy</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Markers are <strong>structural particles</strong>, not content words.</p>
            <h4>Predicate Marker — <code>lo</code></h4>
            <ul>
                <li><code>lo</code> marks the <strong>start of the main predicate</strong> of a clause.</li>
                <li>Exactly <strong>one main predicate</strong> is allowed per clause.</li>
                <li>Any verb appearing before <code>lo</code> is <strong>not</strong> the clause root.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Structure: subject + <code>lo</code> + verb phrase</strong></p>
            <h4>Object Marker — <code>te</code></h4>
            <ul>
                <li><code>te</code> marks the <strong>start of the direct object phrase</strong>.</li>
                <li>Everything following <code>te</code> belongs to the object unless regrouped.</li>
                <li>This prevents verbs inside noun phrases from being misinterpreted as predicates.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><code>ne</code> acts as a modifier. eg <code>mi lo cali ne</code> (I am not moving)</li>
                        <li><code>je</code> acts as a plural indication. eg  <code>mazo je</code> (the trees)</li>

            <h4>Rule 12: Mood Tags &amp; Punctuation</h4>
            <p>A Fiwo sentence <strong>may begin</strong> with a <strong>Mood Tag</strong>.</p>
            <p>Mood Tags explicitly encode the <strong>speaker’s communicative intent or tone</strong>, information that is normally conveyed through body language, facial expression, or vocal intonation in face-to-face speech but is often lost in written text.</p>
            <p>Mood Tags apply to the <strong>entire sentence</strong> and must appear as the <strong>first character</strong>, before any words.</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>

            </table>
            <p>If no Mood Tag is present, the sentence is interpreted as <strong>neutral / declarative by default</strong>.</p>
            <h4>Punctuation Rules</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Punctuation marks (<code>. , " "</code>) function as in standard written languages.</li>
                <li>Capitalization is <strong>not used</strong>, except optionally for <strong>proper nouns</strong>.</li>
                <li>Mood Tags are <strong>not punctuation</strong> and do not replace sentence-final marker, thus all sentences must end in a period.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Design Note</h4>
            <p>Mood Tags increase clarity in text-based communication by making intent explicit, improving both human understanding and machine interpretation without relying on inference.</p>
            <p>The core grammar contains no exceptions; modes affect enforcement, not structure.</p>
            <h4>Rule 13: Closed-Class Grammar (Structural Integrity)</h4>
            <p>Grammar / Miscellaneous words in Fiwo form a <strong>closed class</strong>.</p>
            <p>They exist solely to encode <strong>structure, logic, scope, or sentence control</strong>, not real-world meaning.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Grammar words <strong>must not</strong> describe entities, qualities, states, degrees, time, or uncertainty.</li>
                <li>Grammar words <strong>must not</strong> answer <em>what, who, where, when, how, or why</em>.</li>
                <li>Grammar words <strong>cannot</strong> be replaced by a noun, verb, modifier, or preposition.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>New grammar particles may only be introduced if they:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>encode syntactic or logical structure, and</li>
                <li>do not carry independent semantic content.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This rule prevents semantic drift, preserves morphological transparency, and ensures the grammar layer remains stable and predictable for both humans and machines.</p>
            <h4>Rule 14: Deterministic Parsing (Single-Tree Requirement)</h4>
            <p>Any valid Fiwo sentence in <strong>Strict Mode</strong> must produce <strong>exactly one possible syntactic parse tree</strong>.</p>
            <p>This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>only one main predicate per clause,</li>
                <li>only one valid object scope,</li>
                <li>unambiguous modifier attachment,</li>
                <li>no interpretation based on context, pragmatics, or speaker intent.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This requirement is enforced through:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>fixed functional vowels (word categories),</li>
                <li>fixed word order (SVO),</li>
                <li>mandatory structural markers (<code>lo</code>, <code>te</code>, <code>pii</code>) in Strict Mode.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If a sentence allows more than one valid structural interpretation, it is <strong>invalid in Strict Mode</strong> and must be rewritten using markers or grouping particles. Only structurally complete sentences are considered valid Fiwo.</p>
            <p>This rule guarantees lossless, machine-safe communication and prevents ambiguity from scaling as sentence complexity increases.</p>
