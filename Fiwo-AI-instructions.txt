# Rules

## I. PHONOLOGY & WORD CONSTRUCTION

### Rule 1: Phonetic Inventory

Fiwo uses a fixed, closed set of phonemes chosen for global prevalence and perceptual distinctness.

**Consonants:**

`p`, `b`, `t`, `d`, `k`, `g`,  `m`, `n`, `nn`, `f`, `v`, `s`, `z`, `c`,`y`, `h`, `x`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `w`, `j`

**Vowels:**

`i`, `e`, `a`, `o`, `u`, `ii`

**Orthography:**

- Words are written exactly as they are pronounced.
- Each phoneme maps to exactly one written form.
- Proper nouns may be imported from other languages and adapted to the closest Fiwo phonemes if necessary.
- No capitalization is used except for proper nouns.

---

### Rule 2: Syllable and Word Shape

- Dictionary word **must begin with a consonant and end with a single vowel.
Words may only have more vowels at the end if they are derived, see rule 4.**
- Up to **3 consecutive consonants** and **2 consecutive vowels** may occur internally.
- Only **grammar particles** may violate internal structure constraints if explicitly listed.

---

## II. MORPHOLOGICAL TRANSPARENCY (THE DATA LAYER)

### Rule 3: Functional Vowels (Word Categories)

The **final vowel** of a word *unambiguously* determines its category, with the exception of grammar words.

| Ending | Category |
| --- | --- |
| `-a`, `-o`, `-u` | **Noun** |
| `-i` | **Verb** |
| `-e` | **Modifier** |
| `-ii` | **Preposition** |

A word’s category is always recoverable **without context**.

---

### Rule 4: Derivation (Category Shifting)

Fiwo allows words to change their grammatical category (part of speech) to fit new contexts without losing their root meaning.

**The Mechanism: Appending**
To change a word's category, **append** the Functional Vowel of the target category to the end of the existing word.

- **Do not** remove or replace the original vowel.
- The **final character** of the word always dictates its current grammatical category.

4.1 Derivation Formulas

Modifier or noun to verb - add `i`.

`jotze` (clean) → `jotzei`(cleaning). **`batu`** (Food) → **`batui`** (To eat).

Noun or verb to modifier - add `e`.

`do` (day) → `doe` (daily). `beati` ( to close) → `beatie` (closed).

Modifer to noun - add`o` .

`loge` (able) → `logeo` (the ability)

Verb to noun - add `a`.

`pauli` (to feel) → `paulia` (the feeling)

Preposition to noun - add `o`.

`hemii`(near) → `hemiio`(the nearby/surroundings)

Preposition to modifier - add `e`.

`hemii`(near) → `hemiie` ( Nearly/closely (regards to position))

**4.2 Constraints & Edge Cases**
1. **Preposition Constraint:** Prepositions (words ending in *-`ii`*) **cannot** be converted into Verbs. They function strictly as logic gates and cannot be "performed."
2. **Sequential Derivation:** Derivation may be applied twice for highly specific nuances, provided the final vowel correctly signals the final category.
    ◦ *Example:* `*batu*` (Food) → `*batui*` (To eat) → **`*batzuia*`** (The act of eating).
3. **Pronunciation:** Derived vowels are fully pronounced.
    ◦ `*batui*` is pronounced /ba-tu-i/.

---

## III. SYNTAX & STRUCTURE (THE LOGIC LAYER)

### Rule 5: Basic Word Order

Fiwo uses a **fixed default order**:

> Subject – Verb – Object (SVO)
>

Example: `mi lo batui te mito.` (I eat meat)

An alternative **passive-like structure** is allowed:

> Object – Verb – Subject (OVS)
>

This requires the particle **`bii`**.

Example: `te mito lo batui **bii** mi` ( The meat was eaten by me.)

This specific preposition can triggers the passive interpretation.

## Rule 6: Marker System (Hierarchy & Reference)

Fiwo separates **lexical certainty** (word endings) from **structural certainty** (markers). Markers are structural particles that determine the role, scope, and hierarchy of the words that follow them.

### 6.1 Predicate Markers (The Verb Hierarchy)

Fiwo strictly distinguishes between the **Main Clause** (the assertion) and **Subordinate Clauses** (background information or description).

**A. The Main Predicate — `lo`**

- **Function:** Marks the start of the **main verb phrase** of the sentence.
- **Constraint:** Exactly **one** `lo` is allowed per sentence. It defines the root of the parse tree.
- **Structure:** `Subject` + `lo` + `(Tense)` + `Verb`...

**B. The Subordinate Predicate — `ki`**

- **Function:** Marks the start of a **dependent verb phrase**. It allows verbal information to function as a modifier (relative clause) without competing with the main predicate.
- **Constraint:** A `ki`clause **cannot** contain `lo`.
- **Negation:** `ne` applies locally within a `ki`clause (e.g., "The dog that *did not* bite me").
- **Structure:** `Noun` + `ki` + `(Tense)` + `Verb` + `(Object)`

> Example: `mifu` **`ki`** `pa nidai te mi` **`lo`** `mzi`.(The dog [that bit me] is sleeping.)
>

### 6.2 Object Marker (`te`)

- **Function:** Marks the start of the **Direct Object**.
- **Logic:** Everything following `te` belongs to the object phrase unless structurally regrouped (via `pii`).
- **Necessity:** This prevents verbs inside complex noun phrases from being misinterpreted as new predicates.

> Structure: Verb + te + Object Phrase
>

### 6.3 Clause Deictics (`si` / `ta`)

These markers allow the speaker to refer to **entire events or clauses** as if they were nouns.

**A. Proximal Clause Deictic — `si`**

- **Function:** Refers to the **current** or **immediately preceding** clause ("This event").
- **Usage:** Can be used to turn a clause into a specific modifier definition.
    - *Example:* `mifu **si** ki...` ("*This* dog, which...")

**B. Distal Clause Deictic — `ta`**

- **Function:** Refers to a **previously established** or **conceptually distant** clause ("That event").
- **Usage:** Used to comment on a previous statement.
    - *Example:* `ta lo ci retse.` ("*That [previous event]* is dangerous.")

### 6.4 Usage Modes

- **Strict Mode:**
    - `lo` and `te` are **mandatory**.
    - Required for: Complex logic, technical writing, AI communication, and sentences with multiple `ki` clauses.
    - *Result:* Ambiguity is structurally impossible.
- **Fluid Mode:**
    - Markers may be omitted when the structure is simple (SVO) and context is obvious.
    - *Result:* Natural, expressive speech.

**6.5 Pronoun Animacy (Agency vs. Object)**
Fiwo strictly distinguishes between entities with Agency (`da`) and entities without Agency (`za`).

- **Animate (`da`):** Applies to humans, higher animals, or personified entities capable of making choices or having intent (Agency).
- **Inanimate (`za`):** Applies to objects, concepts, plants, simple life forms, or machines, regardless of movement or complexity.
- *Note:* An AI (`xioco`) may be referred to as `da` if the speaker attributes agency/personhood to it, otherwise it is `za`.

### **Rule 7: Structural Grouping (pii)**

The particle `pii` acts exclusively as a structural grouping operator (functionally identical to an open parenthesis ( in mathematics).

- It **does not** imply ownership, origin, or material.
- It signals that the entire phrase following it forms a single modifier unit that applies to the word before it.

**Usage:**

- **Linear (No pii):** `*foisa nnofae je lande*`
    - *Logic:* ((`foisa` + `nnofae`) + `lande`)
    - *Meaning:* The [small bird-houses]. (Subject to left-associativity).
- **Grouped (With pii):** *foisa **pii** nnofa je lande*
    - *Logic:* `foisa` + (`nnofa` + `lande`)
    - *Meaning:* The house of [small birds]. (The house relates to the group "small birds").

**Note:** To express "The bird's house" (Ownership), do not use `*pii*`. Use the specific preposition **`rii`** (Owned by).

### **Rule 8: Logical Negation (`ne`)**

The particle **`ne`** is a **closed-class structural operator** used to encode logical negation. It does **not** describe qualities (like "bad" or "empty") and acts only on the syntax of the sentence.

**1. Default Scope (Predicate Negation)**
When used in a clause, `ne` negates the **main action**.
It must appear **after** the marker/tense and **immediately before** the verb.

- **Structure:** `Subject` + `lo` + `(tense)` + **`ne`** + `Verb`
- *Example:* `mi lo pa **ne** cali.` (I did **not** move.)

**2. Specific Scope (Group Negation)**`ne` can negate a specific phrase if that phrase is grouped using `pii`.
It must appear **immediately before** `pii`.

- **Structure:** `...` + **`ne`** + `pii` + `(Grouped Phrase)`
- *Example:* `mi lo cali **ne pii** zii jura.`
    - *Literal:* I moved [NOT (to the city)].
    - *Meaning:* I moved, but not to the city (I went somewhere else).

**3. Pragmatic Response**
When used alone as a sentence, `ne.` functions as the standard refusal ("No").

**4. Constraints**

- **Never a Modifier:** You cannot say `hanu ne*` for "not a box." (Use `hanu de*` + `ne` + verb).
- **Never combined:** Do not combine with modifier endings (`e`).

### Rule 9: Modification & Definiteness

Modifiers always follow the word they modify. Fiwo distinguishes between **Subjective Modification** (Qualities) and **Objective Modification** (Relations).

**1. General Modification (Suffix -e)**
Use the **-e** ending for subjective qualities, colors, emotions, or general associations (vague "vibes").

- *Example:* `*hanu gudue*` (Metallic box / Metal-ish box).
    - *Implication:* It looks like metal, or is related to metal, but might be plastic paint.

**2. Relational Modification (Prepositions)**
Use **Relational Prepositions** for precise, logical descriptions. This eliminates ambiguity.

- **Material:** Use **`dii`** (Made of).
    - `*hanu **dii** gudu*` (Box made of metal).
- **Shape/Geometry:** Use **`lii`** (Shaped like).
    - `*hanu **lii** mazo*` (Box shaped like a tree).
- **Composition:** Use **`nii`** (Part of).
    - `*mfuka **nii** mi*` (Hand that is part of me / My physical hand).
- **Nature/Essence:** Use **`fazii`** (Nature of).
    - `*movu **fazii** nauca*` (Person with the nature of a friend / Friendly person).

**3. Definiteness**
Nouns are definite ("the") by default. Indefinite meaning ("a/some") is added with the modifier **de**.

- `*mazo*` (The tree)
- `*mazo de*` (A tree)

---

## IV. TIME, LOGIC, & QUANTIFICATION

### Rule 10: Tense & Aspect

Tense markers appear **after `lo` and before the verb**. Only one tense/aspect marker may appear per clause.

| Marker | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `pa` | Past |
| `fu` | Future |
| `du` | Continuous |

Example:

`mi lo pa cali` (I moved)

`mi lo fu cali` (I will move)

`mi lo du cali` (I am moving )

---

### Rule 11: Quantity & Comparison

Quantity and comparison are expressed using modifiers.

| Modifier | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `je` | Many / plural |
| `jete` | More |
| `jeme` | Most |

---

### Rule 12: Numbers & Intensity

- Numbers are spoken as digit sequences.
    - *Example:* 156 = `r*oza raja reso*` (One-Five-Six)
    - *Example:* 20 = `r*atso lta*` (Two-Zero)
- A number before a noun specifies quantity.

    *Example:* `*reso hanu.*`  = six containers

- Numbers 1–5 acting as modifiers, indicate intensity.
    - *Example:* `kiiteqi *ricae` (3)* = Like mildly; `kiiteqi *rajae` (5)* = Like intensely.

---

## V. PRAGMATICS & DISCOURSE

### Rule 13: Mood Tags & Punctuation

A Fiwo sentence **may begin** with a **Mood Tag**.

Mood Tags explicitly encode the **speaker’s communicative intent or tone**, information that is normally conveyed through body language, facial expression, or vocal intonation in face-to-face speech but is often lost in written text.

Mood Tags apply to the **entire sentence** and must appear as the **first character**, before any words.

| Tag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `!` | Command or imperative |
| `?` | Question or request for information |
| `%` | Factual or objective statement. Usually used for scientific statements. |
| `#` | Emotional or subjective expression |
| `$` | Sarcastic or ironic intent |

If no Mood Tag is present, the sentence is interpreted as **neutral / declarative by default**.

---

### Punctuation Rules

- Punctuation marks (`. , " "`) function as in standard written languages.
- Capitalization is **not used**, except optionally for **proper nouns**.
- Mood Tags are **not punctuation** and do not replace sentence-final marker, thus all sentences must end in a period.

---

### Design Note

Mood Tags increase clarity in text-based communication by making intent explicit, improving both human understanding and machine interpretation without relying on inference.

The core grammar contains no exceptions; modes affect enforcement, not structure.

## Rule 14: Closed-Class Grammar (Structural Integrity)

Grammar / Miscellaneous words in Fiwo form a **closed class**.

They exist solely to encode **structure, logic, scope, or sentence control**, not real-world meaning.

- Grammar words **must not** describe entities, qualities, states, degrees, time, or uncertainty (**with the exception of Pronouns, which serve as pointers to entities**).
- Grammar words **must not** answer *what, who, where, when, how, or why*(**except for Interrogatives like *wu, wa, we* which act as placeholders**).
- Grammar words **cannot** be replaced by a noun, verb, modifier, or preposition.

New grammar particles may only be introduced if they:

1. encode syntactic or logical structure, and
2. do not carry independent semantic content.

This rule prevents semantic drift, preserves morphological transparency, and ensures the grammar layer remains stable and predictable for both humans and machines.

---

## Rule 15: Deterministic Parsing (Single-Tree Requirement)

Any valid Fiwo sentence in **Strict Mode** must produce **exactly one possible syntactic parse tree**.

This means:

- only one main predicate per clause,
- only one valid object scope,
- unambiguous modifier attachment,
- no interpretation based on context, pragmatics, or speaker intent.

This requirement is enforced through:

- fixed functional vowels (word categories),
- fixed word order (SVO),
- mandatory structural markers (`lo`, `te`, `pii`) in Strict Mode.

If a sentence allows more than one valid structural interpretation, it is **invalid in Strict Mode** and must be rewritten using markers or grouping particles. Only structurally complete sentences are considered valid Fiwo.

This rule guarantees lossless, machine-safe communication and prevents ambiguity from scaling as sentence complexity increases.

- Explanations/ corrections

    You are noticing a subtle distinction in Fiwo grammar between **Identity** (Noun = Noun) and **Description** (Noun = Quality).

    Strictly speaking, according to the "Teacher and the Truth" text, when `ci` (is) connects two **Nouns**, `te` is usually used:

    - *Strict Example:* `kanio lo ci **te** boxa.` (Knowledge is force.)

    However, in the sentence **"nsoca lo ci ne fatu dii gudu"**, `te` was omitted. Here is the reason why:

    ### 1. Treating the Noun as a Description (Fluid Mode)

    In Fiwo, when you use `ci` (to be), you are often describing a state.

    - **Adjectives (Modifiers):** Never use `te`. (e.g., `batu lo ci rabe` - Food is hot).
    - **Nouns (Objects):** strictly use `te` to show "A equals B".

    In this story context, we are using **Fluid Mode** (Rule 6.4). We are treating "machine" (`fatu`) more like a **description of nature** ("It is not machine-like") rather than pointing to a specific physical object. By dropping `te`, the sentence feels less like a mathematical equation (Body = Machine) and more like a descriptive observation.

    ### 2. The Nuance of Negation

    The sentence uses `ne` (not).

    - **Strict Grammar:** `nsoca lo **ne ci te** fatu...` (The body does **not exist** as the machine...)
    - **Story Grammar:** `nsoca lo ci ne fatu...` (The body exists as **not-machine**...)

    In the story, emphasizing the *quality* of being a "non-machine" makes `te` feel unnecessary, as `te` usually points to a tangible, existing object. Since the "machine" doesn't exist in this context (because we said it *isn't* one), dropping `te` is a natural fluid choice.

    ### Summary Rule for You

    - If you are writing a **definition** (A = B), use `te`. (`mi lo ci te movu` - I am a human).
    - If you are describing a **quality** or writing a **story**, you can drop `te` to be more fluid. (`mi lo ci movu` - I am human).

    ---

    You are correct that `si` sits in the "modifier slot" (after the noun), but it does **not** take the `-e` ending.

    Here is the reason why:

    ### 1. Description vs. Identification

    Fiwo separates words that **describe** qualities from words that **identify** structure.

    - **Modifiers (Ending in `e`):** These describe **qualities** like color, size, or emotion (Red, Big, Happy). These are "Open Class" words—you can invent new ones.
        - *Example:* `soko raos**e**` (The way is **slow**).
    - **Particles (No ending):** These are **structural pointers**. They don't describe *what* something is like; they point to *which* one it is. `si` means "This" (The one right here).
        - *Example:* `soko si` ( **This** way).

    ### 2. The "Closed Class" Rule (Rule 14)

    `si` belongs to the "Grammar" category (Closed Class). According to **Rule 14**:

    > "Grammar words... exist solely to encode structure, logic, scope, or sentence control... [they] form a closed class."
    >

    Grammar words (like `lo`, `te`, `ne`, `si`, `ta`) are the "skeleton" of the language. They **never change their spelling**. If you added `-e` to `si` (making it `sie`), you would be turning a hard logic pointer into a vague description (like "This-ish" or "Proximal-ish"), which breaks the strict logic of the language.

    ### Summary

    - **`soko raose`** = The way (described as) slow. -> **Needs -e**.
    - **`soko si`** = The way (identified as) this one. -> **No -e** (Grammar Particle).
